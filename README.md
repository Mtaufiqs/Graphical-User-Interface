<p align = "justify">C# syntax is highly expressive,yet it is also simpleand easy to learn.Thecurly-bracesyntax of C# will beinstantly
recognizableto anyonefamiliar with C, C++, or Java. Developers who know any of theselanguages aretypically
ableto begin to work productively in C# within a short time. C# syntax simplifies many of thecomplexities of C++
and provides powerful features such as nullabletypes,enumerations, delegates, lambdaexpressions,and direct
memory access. C# supports generic methods and types, which provideincreased typesafety and performance,
and iterators, which enableimplementers of collection classes to definecustom iteration behaviors thataresimple
to use by client code.Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions makethestrongly typed query a first-class

As an object-oriented language, C# supports theconcepts of encapsulation, inheritance,and polymorphism. All
variables and methods, including the Main method, theapplication's entry point,areencapsulated within class
definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implementany number of interfaces.
Methods that overridevirtual methods in a parent class requirethe override keyword as a way to avoid accidental
redefinition. In C#,a struct is likea lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated typethat can implement interfaces but
does not support inheritance.

In addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# makes iteasy to develop softwarecomponents through
several innovativelanguageconstructs, including thefollowing:
* Encapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enabletype-safeevent notifications.
* Properties, which serveas accessors for private member variables.
* Attributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time.
* Inline XML documentation comments.
* Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which provides built-in query capabilities across a variety of data
  sources.

If you haveto interact with other Windows softwaresuch as COM objects or native Win32 DLLs,you can do this in
C# through a process called "Interop". Interop enables C# programs to do almostanything thata native C++
application can do. C# even supports pointers and theconcept of "unsafe" codefor thosecases in which direct

memory access is critical.

The C# build process is simplecompared to C and C++ and moreflexiblethan in Java.Thereare no separate
header files,and no requirement that methods and types be declared in a particular order. A C# sourcefile may
defineany number of classes, structs, interfaces,and events.
